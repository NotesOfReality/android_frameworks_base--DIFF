I hope this whole repo can be a bit informative to anybody approaching to the "little world" of the modifications of the "framework_base" build module.

This branch partially is the "framework_base" build module "lineage-15.1" branch of the repo from https://github.com/LineageOS/android_frameworks_base/tree/lineage-15.1 THANKS @LineageOS .

| Features I added: |
| :---------------------- |
| - Custom "Ambient Display/Doze" package support ----> Look at all the last three commits made on the 24th of November 2018 |

At 99% percent it's other devs work, I'm too lazy to list them in credits, so if anybody feels anger towards me... Well I first beg your pardon, then give you all the credits you want :P :)
