I hope this whole repo can be a bit informative to anybody approaching to the "little world" of the modifications of the "framework_base" build module.

This branch partially is the "framework_base" build module "o8.1" branch of the repo from https://github.com/AICP/frameworks_base/tree/o8.1 THANKS @AICP .

| Features I added: |
| :---------------------- |

At 99% percent it's other devs work, I'm too lazy to list them in credits, so if anybody feels anger towards me... Well I first beg your pardon, then give you all the credits you want :P :)
